    Dear <%= @user.name.split.first %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for adopting one of more than 40,000 storm drains in the City of Virginia Beach and keeping it free of leaves and debris. You are joining your neighbors in helping to protect the environment, manage stormwater, and minimize flooding. 
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">How to Care For Your Adopted Drain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If possible, clear the storm drain at least six times per year, most importantly before it rains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the storm drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a broom, rake or shovel to clear debris from the area around your storm drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Report clogged or damaged storm drains to the City by calling (757)385-1470.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">Drain Cleaning Safety Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Never try to lift the drain grate or go into the storm drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Only clear debris that is on top of the drain or in the gutter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear from the sidewalk, not the street.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wear reflective clothing so vehicles can see you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always wear gloves and be very careful of sharp objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      If children are helping, be sure adults are supervising.
    </li>
  </ul>
